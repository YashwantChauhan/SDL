                Radiation is often categorized as either ionizing or non-ionizing depending on the energy of the
                radiated particles. Ionizing radiation carries more than 10 eV, which is enough to ionize atoms and
                molecules and break chemical bonds. This is an important distinction due to the large difference in
                harmfulness to living organisms. A common source of ionizing radiation is radioactive materials that
                emit α, β, or γ radiation, consisting of helium nuclei, electrons or positrons, and photons,
                respectively. Other sources include X-rays from medical radiography examinations and muons, mesons,
                positrons, neutrons and other particles that constitute the secondary cosmic rays that are produced
                after primary cosmic rays interact with Earth's atmosphere.

                Gamma rays, X-rays and the higher energy range of ultraviolet light constitute the ionizing part of the
                electromagnetic spectrum. The word "ionize" refers to the breaking of one or more electrons away from an
                atom, an action that requires the relatively high energies that these electromagnetic waves supply.
                Further down the spectrum, the non-ionizing lower energies of the lower ultraviolet spectrum cannot
                ionize atoms, but can disrupt the inter-atomic bonds which form molecules, thereby breaking down
                molecules rather than atoms; a good example of this is sunburn caused by long-wavelength solar
                ultraviolet. The waves of longer wavelength than UV in visible light, infrared and microwave frequencies
                cannot break bonds but can cause vibrations in the bonds which are sensed as heat. Radio wavelengths and
                below generally are not regarded as harmful to biological systems. These are not sharp delineations of
                the energies; there is some overlap in the effects of specific frequencies.[3]</div>
